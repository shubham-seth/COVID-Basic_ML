# COVID-Basic_ML
Hey guys, so this is a model I trained. Keep in mind, its very primitive, like I spent only 30-45mins on this kinda primitive
Also, if you guys are wondering, I just used linear regression. The feature I selected was of the form ax/(x^2+bx+c).
Simple MSE loss and Gradient Descent were used to write it.
